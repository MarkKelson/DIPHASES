# PAbySES_sysreview
The repository contains the raw data files and code to replicate all of the analysis in our systematic review

There are three data files
1. PA sys rev data.xlsx  # This contains individual study information like sample sizes, means split by groups, SDs. One row for each comparison. 
2. Study_Summary_Info.xlsx  # This contains one row for each study summarises study level characteristics
3. GW4 reviewBCT's.xlsx. # The second worksheet of this file contains summary information for each study on the behaviour change techniques employed. 

and a code file

4. PA sys rev code.R

and a Rmarkdown file for creating our supplement

5. Supplementary_material.Rmd



To replicate the analyses you should download all files, amend file paths in document 4 (which calls files 1-3) and then run all of the code in document 4. Document 5 will produce the supplementary material.
